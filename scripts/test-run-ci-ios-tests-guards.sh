# Exercise the merge gate's own assertions without running the merge gate.
#
# Run through make test-ci-guards, locally or in the mandatory macOS CI worker.
# It proves the gate's guards can fail without building or running the app.
#
# The guards it exercises are the ones the full lane gained under #135. Those
# guards exist because a gate run reported `864 tests in 92 suites passed` while
# 95 of those tests executed nothing, so the standard they are held to here is
# that each one has been *seen* to go red for its own stated reason. A guard
# that has only ever been seen green is not known to work.
#
# Four properties of this script matter as much as the cases:
#
#   * It does not copy the guards. It extracts their function text verbatim out
#     of scripts/run-ci-ios-tests.sh and evals it, so what runs here is the code
#     that ships. A transcription would drift silently and this file would keep
#     reporting green about a function nobody runs.
#   * It does not restate the gate's numbers either. The executed floor is read
#     back out of the gate's own call site, because a second copy of it here
#     drifted silently and left the gate loosenable with every case still green.
#   * A red case must print the words of the guard it is named after, not merely
#     exit non-zero. One case here used to go red through a different guard than
#     its name claimed, which reads as coverage while being none.
#   * It refuses to report success having run nothing. A missing function, a
#     missing call site, a swapped capture and a miscounted case list are all
#     fatal. Passing zero cases while printing a summary is precisely the
#     failure #135 exists to oppose, and it would be an unusually poor thing to
#     ship inside the fix for it.
#
# Fixtures are derived from one committed capture of a real passing gate run,
# scripts/testdata/gate-2f50170.log, whose only edit is that the developer home
# path it was recorded under is rewritten to /Users/ci. That substitution is
# mechanical and total, and provably touches no line any guard or the lane
# splitter reads. Everything else -- the per-lane logs the gate writes, and
# every degraded variant -- is generated from it here, so a fresh clone
# reproduces the whole set with no manual reconstruction.
