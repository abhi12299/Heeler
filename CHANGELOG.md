# Changelog

All notable changes to Heeler are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Entries reference the issue that motivated them.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- A Dictate button in the Composer: it focuses the draft with the system
  keyboard already listening, so you can speak a message with Apple's own
  dictation. It needs dictation enabled in iOS Settings.
- Background Alerts for the free Apple ID build, which cannot receive push:
  Heeler stays running in the background on a silent, mixable audio session
  and posts Agent Notifications itself when an Agent finishes or needs input.
  On by default under Settings > Notifications; tapping one opens the Agent.
- Custom Agents: start an Agent through your own shell alias or function
  (for example `cg`) from New Agent. The app types the command into the new
  pane's shell, where your aliases exist, then names the Agent herdr detects.
  You can add arguments and environment variables; `~` and `$HOME` resolve to
  the Host's home.
  New Agent also reopens on the Agent you last started on that Host.
- Tailscale SSH Hosts: choose Tailscale SSH as a Host's authentication method,
  or scan a Tailscale SSH Pairing Code, to connect through tailscaled with no
  OpenSSH server and nothing enrolled on the machine. A `check` policy's login
  link appears in the app while the connection waits for approval.
- `make free-install` builds and installs Heeler with a free Apple ID, without
  push notifications or Live Activities.
- Autocorrect and spell checking in native Composer drafts. Direct Input and
  shell terminals keep them off. (#407)
- Manual SSH connections to native Windows herdr 0.9.3 or newer, including
  default and named sessions, live Agent and shell terminals, and Windows
  directory navigation. Windows uses herdr's official API bridge and terminal
  controller. Pairing, Changes, Skills, file uploads, and notification
  registration remain unavailable on Windows. (#400)
- Long-press an Agent row to close its pane, tab, or workspace, with the same
  confirmation as the swipe action. (#408)
- Agent and terminal screens on iPhone have floating glass buttons for Back,
  the Workspace's terminals, and an Agent's Changes. They start folded to a
  single button and stay shown once the user opens them. Swiping back from
  either follows the finger like any other screen. (#409)

### Fixed

- Fix Agent terminal connections failing when an older system herdr shadows the user's updated installation. (#404)
- Opening an Agent from the iPhone Agent list no longer shows the input bar
  a tab bar's height too high before it drops to the bottom of the screen.
  (#406)

- Preserve literal absolute Unix API endpoints without a HOME probe, and keep
  Windows API and terminal connections on the selected session when SSH
  inherits legacy socket overrides. (#400)
- Large diffs in Changes no longer wait for the Git timeout when the SSH
  connection briefly cannot send. (#402)

## [0.1.12] - 2026-10-02

### Added

- Changes shows what is uncommitted in the Checkout an Agent is working in.
  Open it from the Agent's More menu, or tap the branch or totals on the
  status line above the input; Back or a swipe to the right returns to the
  Agent. Files are grouped as in VS Code's Source Control
  (Conflicts, Staged, Changes, Untracked), one line each with its folder,
  line counts, and status letter. Tap a file for its diff, with changed
  words highlighted and side by side on iPad. Git runs on the Host over SSH
  without hooks, file-system monitors, or index writes. (#382)
- The Agents list and Agent detail's status line show each Checkout's line
  totals, such as +12 −7, or Tide's file counts, such as +1 !2 ?3, when no
  line changed. The status line also shows the branch and its upstream
  distance as Tide does, as main ⇣1 ⇡2. Both refresh when the Agent stops
  working or its Host reconnects. (#382)

### Changed

- The Dynamic Island says what its numbers mean: each status is a glyph with
  its count, an exclamation mark for Blocked, a check mark for Done, and an
  open ring for Working. The most urgent status sits left of the camera and
  the others sit right, so one status no longer shows the same number on both
  sides. Expanded, the island leads with that status spelled out and marks
  each Agent with the same glyph. (#398)
- An Agent's row in the Agents list ends its second line with the Host name
  rather than its last, making room for the Checkout's line totals there.
  (#382)

### Fixed

- On iPad, a short Agents list shown over the detail no longer starts with
  its first row under the search field. (#397)

## [0.1.11] - 2026-09-28

### Added

- The Console has Agents, Terminals, Hosts, and Settings tabs in a bottom
  tab bar, and reopens the list tab last shown. Hosts and Settings replace
  the toolbar's Hosts and Settings buttons, and a Host opened from a Host
  problem in another tab goes back to that tab. An iPad beside its sidebar
  has no tab bar: the sidebar switches between Agents and Terminals from a
  menu on its title, and opens Hosts and Settings as sheets from buttons at
  its foot.
  Terminals lists every Host's shell panes as one collapsible card per
  Workspace, By Workspace or By Host, sharing the Agents tab's Host filter.
  A shell in a named tab is listed by that name, and shells sharing a card
  show their tab beside the path. Each card ends in a New Terminal row that
  opens a shell tab in that Workspace, and the toolbar's New Terminal picks
  a Host, an existing or new Workspace, and an optional tab name. Swipe a
  terminal to close it after confirming, or long-press it to open another in
  its Workspace or copy its path. Pull the Terminals list down to search it
  by Host, Workspace, tab, title, or directory. (#316; PR #377)
- A Shell Terminal's input row ends in a keyboard button, as the Agent
  switcher does: it hides the keyboard, the Keys keyboard included, and
  brings the system keyboard back. (PR #381)

### Changed

- A Host's connection state reads at a glance: Host headers in the Agents
  and Terminals tabs lead with a server glyph instead of a line of text, and
  a badge on its corner marks the state: green once connected, an open ring
  while connecting, a spinning orange arc while reconnecting, orange when
  out of sync, and red once the Host stops on a failure, which also dims its
  name. The disclosure chevron moves to the trailing edge, and an expanded
  Host in the Agents tab states its condition as the Terminals tab does.
  (#316; PR #377)
- By Host, in the Agents and Terminals presentation menus, shows an
  indented list instead of the server glyph Hosts uses. (PR #381)
- A Host that is reconnecting or cannot connect no longer expands: tapping
  it opens a sheet with the failure, a Retry button, and Edit for its
  settings. In the flat Agents list and the By Workspace terminals, Hosts
  with a problem gather atop the list: one Host as a short line, several as
  a summary that counts them by state and opens them in a sheet, where each
  failing Host shows its failure and Retry Now. (#316; PR #377)
- The Hosts list groups Hosts by what they need, each group collapsible:
  Can't Connect first, naming each problem beside a refresh button that
  retries, then Hosts still trying, then connected ones with their latency.
  (#316; PR #377)
- On iPad, Agents and Terminals set their list beside the terminal, each
  keeping its own selection and sidebar; in portrait a pick returns to the
  terminal alone, and swiping in from the terminal's left edge brings the
  list back out instead of closing the terminal. The sidebar's buttons
  stand bare on it, with New and Hide Sidebar beside its title even in the
  narrowest window, its list menus sit at its foot, and its search field,
  as on an iPhone, stays out of sight until a list is pulled down. The terminal
  reaches the top of the window, and the status bar takes its colors,
  except beside a sidebar of the other appearance, where a band in the
  app's colors keeps it legible. Sidebar rows mark the
  selection and the keyboard focus with a quiet rounded fill and ring
  instead of a blue band, and long-pressing one lifts a card of it. An
  Agent opened from a notification or from a shell always shows on the
  Agents tab. ⌘N opens New Terminal on the Terminals tab, and the menu names
  each command for the tab on screen. A shell's loading, failure, and closed
  states draw on the terminal's own background. (PR #381)
- On iPad, Hosts and Settings open as centered sheets with Done, a Host
  problem opens its Host there, and a Host's status sheets, New Terminal,
  and New Agent open as centered forms sized to their content, with Done:
  New Agent grows to show its whole form, up to the window's height,
  instead of scrolling inside a fixed form. The buttons on an empty detail
  (Show Agents, New Agent, New Terminal) are full size and one width,
  instead of the small ones sized for a phone. (PR #381)
- The Hosts list marks a connected Host that cannot sync, and a Host with
  Retry opens like every other row. A Host header shows a sync issue ahead
  of loading, and the workspace drawer names shells as the Terminals list
  does. (PR #381)
- Agents search hides under the list's title until you pull the list down,
  and matches an Agent's Host and kind too. While searching, a Host without
  a match leaves the list even when it has a connection problem, and a
  collapsed Host opens to show its matches. (#316; PR #377)

### Fixed

- Pairing names Tailscale SSH when it answers the Pairing Code's port
  instead of OpenSSH, and points at `ssh_port` in the plugin's `pair.json`.
  It used to wait out a `check` policy and report that the Host did not
  answer, or run the enrollment command under an `accept` policy and blame a
  network hiccup; it now stops before authenticating. A pairing command
  that ends without answering is reported as such rather than as a network
  hiccup. (#358; PR #376)
- Rotating a Max iPhone or resizing an iPad window no longer rebuilds an
  open sheet such as Start Agent, which dropped what was typed in it and
  any page pushed inside it. (PR #381)
- In a narrow iPad window, an Agent's terminal and a shell start below the
  window's close and resize controls instead of under them. (PR #381)

## [0.1.10] - 2026-09-23

### Added

- Swipe an Agent row left to close it or right to pin it; a full swipe
  acts at once. Closing always asks first and takes only the Agent's
  pane when its tab holds others. (#366; PR #374)
- The New Agent sheet can create a Workspace from a name alone. A
  name-only launch defaults the directory to the Host's home and the
  workspace label is now a field on the form; a browsed directory still
  overrides it. (#362)
- The Agent terminal shows the session's model, prompt size (as a share of
  the model's context window, `11.0%`, once omp on the Host has named it),
  and spend in a strip above the terminal. These are the figures the Agent's own status line
  prints, but a phone-width terminal runs out of room for them and drops the
  last ones first. Heeler reads them from the Agent's session file on the Host,
  following only what the file gained since the last look, and the strip wears
  the terminal's theme. Only omp reports such a file today; a figure that
  cannot be read is left out rather than shown as a placeholder. When omp's
  own `tok/s` readout is on (`composer.tokenRate`), the strip shows the last
  turn's generation rate too. (#325)
- Pairing Codes can advertise a non-default SSH port via `pair.json`
  (`ssh_port`) in the plugin config directory, so OpenSSH can share a Host
  with Tailscale SSH on port 22. A `pair.json` the plugin cannot honor is
  named in the pair checklist instead of quietly reverting to 22, and a
  checked tailnet address on a Host that is serving Tailscale SSH is called
  out there too — before the QR appears, rather than as a failure on the
  phone. (#355)

### Fixed

- New Agent tabs take the agent's name. `tab.create` now carries it as
  the tab's label, and after a workspace or worktree launch the fresh
  tab is renamed once the agent is running, so the tab bar shows names
  instead of herdr's automatic "Tab N". An optional Tab Name field on
  the form overrides that default with free text, since herdr limits
  agent names to a lowercase slug but not tab labels. (#362)
- Pairing no longer defaults to a Docker bridge address when the Host's
  primary interface has no suitable private or VPN address. Docker bridge
  and veth addresses remain available for manual selection at the end of
  the checklist, without being pre-checked. Normal LAN bridges keep their
  existing selection behavior. (PR #357, refs #356)
- A message sent to an Agent the app had just launched no longer fails with
  "herdr rejected the message: agent wX:pY is not an active named agent".
  herdr 0.8.0+ answers `agent.start` while the pane's agent is still booting,
  and the Console's post-start wait only checks that the Agent's row exists —
  so the first prompt typed into the fresh Agent's tab could beat the agent's
  registration on the Host, and herdr refused the send even though the pane
  id was correct; leaving the Agent and returning was what made sending work.
  The composer now treats that rejection as the launch race it is and waits
  it out at a fixed pace inside the same bounded budget the transport already
  uses for a fresh pane's booting shell, still surfacing herdr's refusal once
  the budget is spent and never retrying a genuinely absent Agent
  (`agent_not_found`). (#368)
- A message sent to an Agent the app had just launched no longer fails with
  "The Host is not connected." Launching an Agent — a new Workspace's Agent in
  particular — makes the Console subscribe to that pane's status events, and
  when the Host's connection has gone quiet or degraded during the launch,
  that subscription swap silently replaces the SSH transport. The Console kept
  reporting the Host as connected while every Host-scoped request — the
  composer's send included — was refused for the seconds the replacement dial
  took, and the first message typed into the fresh Agent's tab died inside
  that window; leaving the Agent and returning was what made sending work.
  Host-scoped requests now wait for the replacement transport instead of
  failing against a gap the connection status never announced, and still fail
  at once with the real cause when the session is suspended, stopped on an
  action-required failure, or visibly reconnecting. A caller that reaches the
  degraded transport before the session notices also gets one redial-and-retry
  instead of a phantom "The Host is not connected." — the case the launch
  window kept producing. (#368)
- Manually adding a Host (or finishing Scan to Pair) no longer loses the
  "Trust this Host?" alert. Navigation into onboarding waits until the add
  sheet has finished dismissing, so preflight's TOFU prompt is not dropped
  mid-transition. (#359)
- Typing into an Agent with Direct Input no longer sends a word twice. The
  iOS keyboard no longer offers autocorrect or QuickType suggestions there or
  in Composer, so pressing Space cannot add a suggested word after the letters
  already typed. Chinese and other input methods keep their candidate bar.
  (PR #349)

## [0.1.9] - 2026-09-19

### Added

- Browse every terminal in the Workspace from a drawer docked to the edge of
  Agent detail. The list groups by Host and Workspace and shows Tab titles,
  paths, and which panes run Agents. A terminal you have opened keeps its
  connection and screen for five idle minutes, up to five per Host; the least
  recently viewed idle one gives way when a sixth is needed. New Terminal
  opens a fresh shell tab in the Workspace. Output stays readable under the
  drawer handle and the message-jump tabs. (#333)

- Choose an existing Workspace or New Workspace from the same dropdown in
  New Agent. New Workspace opens a remote directory browser. The latest directory stays at the
  bottom of the dropdown, with its name and full path shown when selected. (PR #305)
- Hosts can authenticate with a device-generated RSA Key using RSA-SHA2-512,
  including connections through a Jump Host. The private key remains in the
  Keychain and the public key can be copied from Host settings. (PR #347)

### Changed

- The message-jump buttons dock flush against the terminal's edge as a tab,
  matching the Workspace drawer handle. Long-press either to slide it along
  the edge; each stays where you leave it. (#333)
- The Shell Terminal drops its title bar so output runs up to the status bar.
  Back and Close Terminal moved into the More menu on its input row, which now
  stays visible while the keyboard is down. The row's Insert New Line button
  is gone; Shift+Enter on the Keys keyboard sends the same line break. (#333)
- The keyboard follows you between Agent detail and a Shell Terminal: up or
  down, it is the same on the other side, and it stays on screen through the
  switch instead of dropping and rising again. The terminal's Text/Keys row
  sits above it from the first frame, and the two screens dissolve into each
  other instead of cutting. (#333)
- Make the remote directory browser more compact, with full-row folder navigation,
  native filtering, empty states, and retry for failed navigation. (PR #305)

### Fixed

- Connecting to a Host no longer fails intermittently during post-quantum key
  exchange. Roughly one handshake in 256 was rejected by a defect in the SSH
  library, and about twice as often for a Host behind a Jump Host; the app now
  redials once. (#332)
- A saved Host with an authentication method this build does not understand is
  skipped without making the rest of the Host catalog unreadable. (PR #347)
- Show the directory browser on the first New Workspace tap. (PR #305)
- Viewing a Done Agent marks it seen on its Host and refreshes Console and
  Live Activity status, including other Agents in the same Tab. (#314)

## [0.1.8] - 2026-09-13

### Added

- iPad is a first-class target again. App Store builds include iPhone and
  iPad, iPad supports all four interface orientations, and `make sim-ipad` /
  `make test-ipad` run against the iPad simulator. (PR #323)
- Drag text and images into the Composer on iPad. Send stays disabled, with
  a visible "Waiting for image…" hint next to the button, until dropped
  images finish staging. (PR #323)
- Hardware keyboard shortcuts: ⌘1–9 selects visible Agents, ⌘[ / ⌘] switches
  Agents, ⌘F searches, ⌘N starts an Agent, ⌘, opens Settings, ⌘⇧H opens Hosts,
  ⌘E switches Direct Input / Composer, ⌘Return sends the focused Composer draft,
  and ⌘W closes the Agent view. (PR #323)
- On iPad, Heeler opens in more than one window and resizes freely under Stage
  Manager. Long-press an Agent and choose Open in New Window, or drag its row
  out; each window restores its own Agent after a relaunch. Windows on Agents
  of different Hosts are all live at once. A Host has one live terminal, so
  windows on the same Host hand it to the one you last touched or typed in,
  or to a window you just opened; the others show Live in Another Window
  with Take Over Here (not while that Host's Shell Terminal is open), and
  returning to the app leaves it where it was. A notification for an Agent
  already on screen brings that window forward instead of opening another,
  and a live window resize sends the Host one terminal resize once the
  window settles. (PR #323)

### Changed

- Direct Input's More button matches the arrow key size and shortcut spacing,
  with equal padding at the strip's outer edges. (PR #323)
- The Terminal keyboard fills its dock width on iPhone and iPad without
  increasing its height. Character keys share one width across staggered
  rows, with wider Shift, Backspace, and Space keys. Agent and Skills
  keyboard wells remain centered on wide screens. (PR #323)
- On iPad the Composer's tools dock, Direct Input's Keys dock, and the
  Shell terminal's Keys dock no longer leave the system keyboard's floating
  candidate and prediction bar over the dock. (PR #323)
- iPad adapts its two-column Console to landscape and portrait, with a Show Agents
  action in empty detail, form sheets for Hosts, Settings, New Agent, Skills,
  Rename, Snippets, and Worktree, plus Attach Links popovers. (PR #323)

### Fixed

- The pairing popup keeps startup errors on screen until a keypress, instead
  of exiting immediately and closing the Herdr pane. Missing SSH host keys
  now tell the user to enable Remote Login or run `sudo ssh-keygen -A`.
  (#319)
- Agent List Fields no longer refuses every edit after a build with a
  different field set saved on the same device: field names this build does
  not know are dropped on load instead of making the whole saved catalog
  unreadable. When the saved fields truly cannot be read, both Agent List
  Fields screens say so before any edit, keep the fields read-only, and offer
  Reset Saved Fields. (#320; PR #321)

## [0.1.7] - 2026-09-12

### Added

- Muse appears in Start Agent when the Host has `muse` on PATH. Notifications
  and Live Activities name it Muse, and the Heeler plugin accepts `muse`
  sidebar row overrides. (#297)
- Direct Input's shortcut row gains a Paste key after ⇧Enter, so pasting into
  an Agent no longer needs a hardware keyboard. The text goes through the
  same paste review as ⌘V. (#307)
- The Agents list has a search field. Typing filters Agents by working
  directory or title text, combines with the Host filter, and hides empty
  Host sections in grouped mode only while their Host is nominal; a
  reconnecting or failed Host keeps its section. (#292)
- In Compose, swipe between Agent controls and a full Terminal keyboard with
  letters, numbers, symbols, Ctrl/Alt/Shift, and F1–F12. The same keyboard is
  available in Open Terminal's Keys mode. Both pages match the iOS keyboard
  height and preserve the Composer draft. Tap a modifier to apply it to the
  next key; tap it again to cancel. (#270; PR #302)
- Skills and Snippets are available in Direct Input as well as Compose.
  Selecting one inserts it into the active input without pressing Enter.
  (PR #302)
- Hold Backspace for 0.3 seconds to keep deleting; release to stop. This works
  in the Agent controls, Direct Input shortcut row, and full Terminal keyboard.
  (PR #302)

### Changed

- Custom keyboards now use Ghostty's key encoding, which distinguishes more
  Ctrl/Shift combinations and supports enhanced keyboard reporting. Layouts
  and controls stay the same. (PR #298)
- Terminal character keys use larger labels and uppercase letter keycaps.
  Function key labels keep their existing size. (PR #302)
- Direct Input's tools dock opens the full Terminal keyboard without the
  Agent controls page, since those keys are already in the toolbar. (PR #302)
- Agent, Terminal, and Direct Input toolbar keys use a soft gray highlight
  and light haptic feedback when tapped. Agent controls put Backspace at the
  top right and Shift+Tab at the bottom left. The Direct Input shortcut row
  no longer duplicates the Terminal keyboard's Ctrl/Alt buttons. (PR #302)
### Fixed

- Switching Agents keeps the Terminal tools keyboard selected instead of opening
  the iOS keyboard over the controls. Returning from the Agent list no longer
  restores stale keyboard focus, and keyboard height tracking resumes correctly.
  (PR #302)
- Backspace keeps its full touch area while pressed and tolerates small finger
  movements, so holding near an edge no longer cancels deletion. (PR #302)
- Backspace highlights and repeats while held, even when surrounding gestures
  delay button events until release. This applies to Agent controls, the
  Direct Input shortcut row, and the Terminal keyboard. (PR #302)
- Modifier and keyboard layer keys keep their selection color while pressed,
  without flashing gray or shrinking. (PR #302)
- Fixed missed taps on terminal controls near the left edge, where the
  swipe-back gesture could intercept them. (PR #302)
- New Agent now discovers agents installed through mise. The discovery PATH
  includes mise's shims directory, resolved from `MISE_DATA_DIR` or
  `XDG_DATA_HOME` when either reaches the non-interactive SSH environment,
  otherwise `~/.local/share/mise/shims`. (#293)
- The Lock Screen Live Activity shows three Agents with three-row Agent List
  Fields instead of two before "+N more". The row budget overestimated card
  height and its test measured only frame minimums, not the rendered text.
  Four three-row cards exceed ActivityKit's 160 pt limit, so four rows remain
  only for two-row layouts. (#281)
- Console rows show a standard home directory as `~` again: an Agent launched
  in `/Users/aliefe/Code/bitbucket/opinnate-python` prints
  `~/Code/bitbucket/opinnate-python`. Only the SSH account's own `/root`,
  `/Users/<user>`, and `/home/<user>` homes are shortened, so a path that
  merely shares a prefix with a longer account name is left alone. (#311)

## [0.1.6] - 2026-09-09

### Added

- Agent cards and the keyboard switcher use herdr's sidebar fields and Agent
  order. Customize each Host's card layout in Settings > Agent List Fields:
  add, style, move, or remove herdr, Heeler, and plugin fields across up to
  three rows, with a Console preview and automatic saving. Sync from plugin
  refreshes the first two rows; the third defaults to `directory` and keeps
  your edits when syncing. (#277, #281)

- Live Activities follow each Host's Agent List Fields, including directory
  and plugin fields, on the Lock Screen and expanded Dynamic Island. Update
  the Heeler plugin on each Host to use these fields in background updates.
  (#281)

### Changed

- Relicensed the Heeler suite from AGPL-3.0 to Apache License 2.0. (#282)

### Fixed

- Hiding Composer keeps terminal links available through a floating link button
  above the latency indicator. It matches the scroll controls, opens the same
  link list, and does not reduce the terminal's height. (PR #284)

- Secondary field styles now render correctly in Agent cards and previews. (#281)

- Agent List Fields groups each Host's controls in one card, wraps field
  chips, and uses the Console card for its preview, including the status
  badge and Host name. (#281)
- Connecting to a Host whose login shell is nushell or another non-POSIX shell
  no longer fails with "The remote home directory could not be resolved". The
  home probe now runs under POSIX sh, matching the other setup probes. (#275;
  PR #276)

## [0.1.5] - 2026-09-04

### Added

- Agent detail now has up/down buttons for jumping between your messages and
  returning to the latest output. You can use them while the Agent is working,
  and manual scrolling stops a jump. (#268; PR #272)

### Fixed

- Pasting text with Windows-style line breaks now opens the paste review sheet
  instead of submitting each line separately. (#268)

- Terminal layout now updates immediately when the keyboard cannot open. (#263)

- New Agent now finds Agent CLIs installed with Bun, Cargo, Homebrew, or
  Linuxbrew, as well as standard user-local installs. (#254)

## [0.1.4] - 2026-09-01

### Changed

- Agent alerts consistently identify Agents by workspace plus friendly kind.
  Live Activities use compact aligned rows with a colored status dot beside the
  workspace and the friendly kind underneath, without terminal-title,
  custom-name, workdir, or special Blocked-row background noise. (#260)

- Agent cards consistently lead with the herdr workspace or Agent identity,
  followed by the launch directory and a shared Agent-type and Host line;
  terminal-generated titles and TUI metadata no longer compete with that
  hierarchy. (#259)

- When no size has been saved, Terminal Text Size now defaults to 8 pt instead
  of 14 pt. Existing saved sizes do not change. (#256; PR #257)

### Added

- HeelerSSH connections negotiate post-quantum hybrid key exchange
  (`mlkem768x25519-sha256`) against servers that offer it, via a libssh2
  snapshot that carries upstream ML-KEM support; servers without it keep
  using `curve25519-sha256`. (#261)

- Agent detail now offers Direct Input, which hides the Composer and routes iOS
  keyboard input directly to the live Attach PTY. A persistent row above the
  Agent switcher provides Esc, Tab, Shift-Tab, arrow keys, Backspace,
  Shift-Enter, and Enter; keyboard show/hide controls remain in the switcher.
  Composer remains the default. Switching modes preserves the draft and keeps
  a visible iOS keyboard in place. (#251; PR #253)

### Fixed

- Attach terminals begin restoring as soon as a reconnected Host's Transport
  is ready, without waiting for event subscription and snapshot recovery. (#264; PR #265)

## [0.1.3] - 2026-08-28

### Changed

- Live Activity Lock Screen uses system semantic colors and shares the Console
  status palette; it shows up to four Agents in a dense hierarchy, stale
  updates retain an out-of-date caption, and each visible Agent opens its
  detail while the surrounding activity opens the Console. An iOS 27
  ActivityKit regression can still force the Dark appearance and prevent an
  existing activity from refreshing after a system appearance change. (#247)

### Added

- Console can switch between the flat status-sorted Agent list and a by-Host
  grouped list with collapsible sections; collapsed Hosts show Live
  Activity-style Blocked, Working, and Done count pills, and both the
  presentation choice and per-Host collapse state persist across launches.
  (#245)

## [0.1.2] - 2026-08-26

### Added

- Cursor (2.4+) Agents get a Skills catalogue, probed from `.cursor/skills`
  and `.agents/skills` at the project root and home.

- Skills catalogues for thirteen more kinds, each probing its CLI's
  documented directories — Antigravity, Cline, GitHub Copilot CLI, Devin
  CLI, Droid, Grok Build, Hermes Agent, Kilo Code, Kimi CLI, OMP, Kiro CLI,
  Qoder CLI, Qwen Code; Gemini CLI, Amp, Mastra Code, and Maki stay out by
  design.

- Agent detail shows the Host's latest SSH API latency next to Agent status,
  on a status row that now follows the terminal theme's luminance. (#236)

- The Composer suggests discovered Skills inline while an invocation prefix
  is typed, and the More menu gains a searchable Skill picker — both insert
  the command into the draft without sending. (#234)

- Open Terminal in Agent detail's More menu: an interactive shell in the
  Agent's launch directory, one reused tab per Workspace, an IME-safe fixed
  input row, Back for desktop handoff, Close Terminal to reclaim the
  tab. (#231)

- New Agent can start in a new Workspace at a remote directory, with an
  optional label, even when the Host reports none. (#230)

- Console cards mark linked worktrees, whose repository, branch, and
  checkout path show in Agent detail alongside a confirmed remove that keeps
  the local branch. (#99)

### Changed

- Hosts get a distinct Connecting state, separate from automatic
  Reconnecting, a paused connection, and loading Agents on a live events
  path. (#155)

- Failures show a short summary, optional detail, and a recovery suggestion
  only when the error supports one. (#163)

- GhosttyTerminal 1.3.1 → 1.4.0 (Ghostty v1.3.1): surfaces survive window
  detaches, draws pace on a display link, and keyboard input rides the
  upstream key encoder with better IME handling. (#242)

### Fixed

- Covering a terminal with a presentation no longer risks a later crash
  from ghostty's orphaned content layer calling into freed renderer
  memory. (#242)

- A slow ordinary Host request no longer freezes a live Attach session. (#130)

## [0.1.1] - 2026-08-20

### Added

- Qwen Code appears in Start Agent when the Host has `qwen` on PATH. (#216)

- Pairing Codes can be copied from the Host popup with `c` and pasted in the
  app, so pairing no longer depends on scanning a QR that may overflow a
  small terminal. A failed copy prints the code for manual selection. (#204)

### Changed

- When the Agent is Blocked at an approval or question dialog, Composer Send
  types the draft into the live Attach terminal without pressing Enter, then
  shows the tools keyboard so Enter or Esc is one tap. If the Host rejects
  `agent.prompt` with `agent_blocked` after status lagged, Send takes the
  same path instead of showing a rejection. Idle, Working, Done, and Unknown
  still deliver through `agent.prompt`. (#217)

### Fixed

- Connecting to a herdr 0.8.2 Host no longer shows the "newer than this app
  was built against" notice. The committed schema snapshot now matches
  protocol 20. (#218)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-20

### Added

- Pin agents from the Console list with a long-press toggle. Pinned agents
  stay at the top, most recently pinned first. Long-press a chip in the Agent
  switcher on the detail screen to pin or unpin it there too. Lock-screen Live
  Activities show each Host's active agents: status counts plus the top
  agents (pinned eligible first, then blocked, done, working), updating in
  near real time while the app is open and via push after it suspends, ending
  when every agent goes idle. Agent names, titles, and host names stay
  end-to-end encrypted and are decrypted on device at render time; the relay
  sees only the counts. Opt in per Host from Notification Settings; requires
  the updated herdr plugin. (#212)

- Agent detail now places a plus menu to the left of Send. It can add an image
  from Photos or a file up to 64 MiB from Files, stages the selection privately
  on the Host over SFTP, and inserts the resulting path into the local draft
  without submitting it. Discovered Links appear beside the plus menu, while
  the former title-bar Agent actions live in a separate More menu immediately
  to its right. Agent detail omits the visible title bar so terminal output uses
  the full area below the system status bar, while preserving edge-swipe
  navigation and matching status-bar contrast to the terminal theme. (#182)

- Agent detail now combines the complete live libghostty terminal with a local
  Composer. The terminal preserves TUI rendering, scrollback, and PTY resize,
  including touch scrolling in alternate-screen TUIs, but no longer accepts
  direct keyboard, paste, or pointer-click input.
  Drafting makes no network requests;
  Send delivers the complete message once and shows delivery, Agent work, and
  Done states from acknowledgments and status pushes. Failed messages can be
  retried or returned to the draft without losing text, and drafts survive
  terminal recovery, backgrounding, and Host reconnects. The Agent switcher
  sits at the bottom of the Composer, keeping session changes and the keyboard
  toggle within reach without reopening the Console. While the keyboard is
  visible, a neighbouring control switches between the iOS keyboard and a
  tabbed tools keyboard. Its Agent controls send Esc, Tab, Shift-Tab, arrows,
  Enter, and Backspace directly to the Agent without changing the draft.
  The tools dock stays positioned behind the system keyboard and replaces it
  without exposing the disappearing native candidate row as an empty frame.
  Both modes share the same complete measured height, including the native iOS
  candidate and paste area and the Home Indicator area, so switching does not
  move the Composer or change the terminal's root geometry, grid size, or
  rendered frame.
  (#182)

- Settings > About now has Acknowledgements: every redistributed third-party
  component ships with its exact upstream licence notice, including libssh2
  and its secondary sources, OpenSSL, Ghostty and its stack, the monospaced
  fonts, and the rest of the audited inventory. The catalogue fails loudly
  when a notice is missing or malformed. (#161; PR #170)

- The Keys keyboard's three panes — control keys, Snippets, Appearance — now
  swipe. Dragging sideways anywhere on the pane moves it under the finger, the
  tab bar lights the pane being pulled in, and letting go snaps to it; the tabs
  still work as taps. Control keys now send when the finger lifts rather than
  when it lands, so a swipe that starts on Esc switches pane instead of sending
  Esc. Holding a key still repeats.

- Settings now carries an Appearance picker for the app itself: System, Light,
  or Dark. System follows iOS as before and remains the default; the other two
  pin the whole app — Console, sheets, and terminals — to one appearance, and
  the choice sticks across launches.

- Switch Agents without leaving the terminal: a row along the bottom of the
  terminal lists every Agent with its live status — Working agents pulse — and
  scrolls horizontally. It stays put whether the keyboard is up or down, so
  switching Agents no longer means raising the keyboard first, and tapping one
  attaches with the keyboard exactly as it was. A keyboard button pinned at
  the row's trailing edge raises and dismisses the keyboard.

- A dedicated newline button above the iOS keyboard inserts a line break into
  an Agent prompt without pressing Enter or submitting it.

- Hosts now show their live connection state and latest measured ping latency
  in the Hosts list.

- Start another Agent from the one you have open: "New Agent" in the Agent
  detail screen's More menu inherits that Agent's Host, workspace, and working
  directory, so the new Agent starts in a fresh tab in the same place instead
  of at the workspace root. Only the Agent, its name, and its arguments are
  left to fill in.

- Attach Links silently collect web and OSC 8 targets into a memory-only list
  for opening or copying. Links survive terminal recovery and are discarded
  when Attach ends. (#101, #102, #103, #104; PR #105)

- An iPad-fit Console: on regular widths the Agent list becomes a sidebar
  beside the open terminal (a split view) instead of stretching edge to edge,
  and the in-app notification banner caps at a system-banner width. iPhone
  navigation is unchanged.

- Filter the Agent list by Host: with more than one Host configured, a filter
  menu in the Console toolbar narrows the list (and its connection notices) to
  one machine.

- Per-appearance terminal themes: Light Mode and Dark Mode each have their own
  theme slot, so a dark terminal under a light system is one picker away. The
  previously selected theme carries over to both slots on upgrade.
- 20 more curated themes (30 total): Rosé Pine, Ayu, One Half, Kanagawa,
  Everforest, GitHub, Night Owl, Iceberg, Flexoki, Selenized, Modus, Tomorrow,
  Melange, Zenbones, One Dark, Snazzy, Oceanic Next, Poimandres, Horizon,
  Zenburn.
- The terminal theme now owns the whole Attach screen: its background extends
  under the navigation bar and into the home-indicator area, and bar/status-bar
  text follows the theme's luminance instead of the system appearance. (#95)
- An About section on the Settings root with the app version and build number
  plus links to the GitHub repository and the privacy policy.
- Rename Agents and workspaces from the Agent detail screen's menu. Agent
  names follow the server's rule (lowercase letters, digits, `-`/`_`, up to
  32 characters) with inline validation, and leaving the name empty falls
  back to the detected kind. (#98)
- Start an Agent in a fresh git worktree: a "Start in a new worktree" toggle
  on the New Agent form gives the task a clean checkout of the selected
  workspace's repository, with optional branch (validated inline) and base;
  empty fields use herdr's generated `worktree/` branch off HEAD. (#97)

### Changed

- Lock-screen Live Activities now headline the most urgent agent's task
  title and show no Host identity. Each agent row is a tap target that
  opens that agent's detail in the app; a tap outside the rows opens the
  Console. A reconnect no longer treats a transient empty Agent list as
  "all idle" and dismisses the activity.

- Live Activity agent lines now lead with the herdr agent name (e.g.
  `reviewer`) ahead of the task title. Unnamed agents and updates from
  older plugins render exactly as before.

- App Store builds now target iPhone only. The notification service uses the
  same device family, so App Store Connect no longer treats iPad screenshots as
  part of the release requirements.

- Heeler once again supports iOS 18 and later. The removed Dictation feature no
  longer holds the app at iOS 26, and the bundled OpenSSL/libssh2 artifacts now
  share the restored iOS 18 deployment target. (#35)

- Notification setup now distinguishes device registration from per-Host
  configuration, accurately describes relay-visible metadata and Notification
  Key custody, warns when a custom relay uses cleartext HTTP, and uses
  Heeler-branded generic fallback alerts. (PR #195)

- Opening an Agent now gives Heeler priority over an existing terminal client.
  Attach and Reattach use herdr's takeover mode, so a stale mobile connection
  or a desktop client can no longer prevent the Agent detail terminal from
  opening. The displaced client is disconnected.

- A Host whose SSH server has stream-local forwarding turned off now says so
  even when herdr isn't on the SSH session's `PATH`. Heeler tries to start
  herdr once before giving up; when that attempt itself failed, the checks
  used to report "the herdr server is not running" and drop the forwarding
  half of the diagnosis. Since a typical macOS Host keeps herdr at
  `~/.local/bin` or `/opt/homebrew/bin` — neither on the default `PATH` of an
  SSH command — that hit exactly the Hosts most likely to need the forwarding
  advice. (#125)

- Hosts no longer need `socat`. Heeler now reaches herdr's socket over an SSH
  stream-local forward instead of launching a remote helper per request, so
  SSH access and a running herdr server are the whole prerequisite. The socat
  path field is gone from Add/Edit Host, the onboarding checklist has dropped
  its "socat installed" row, and existing Hosts carry over untouched — nothing
  to reconfigure. If a Host's SSH server has stream-local forwarding turned
  off (it is on by default), the checks now say so. (#122)

- The app is now named **Heeler**: the home-screen name, the microphone and
  camera permission prompts, and the notification extension's display name
  all say Heeler instead of Herdr. herdr remains the name of the server it
  connects to; the App Store listing will be "Heeler for herdr". The GitHub
  repository moved to ZingerLittleBee/Heeler and the in-app repository and
  privacy-policy links follow (the old URLs redirect).
- The pairing plugin's id and display name are now both `heeler` (the id was
  `herdr-mobile.pairing`, the display name `Heeler Pairing`). Hosts still
  running the plugin under an old id keep working: Notification Registration
  matches the installed id — current first, then legacy — and writes into
  that plugin's own config directory, so updating the plugin
  (`herdr plugin install ZingerLittleBee/Heeler/plugin --ref main --yes`) can
  happen whenever convenient. After updating it, redo Notification
  Registration from the app once; pairing and SSH access are unaffected
  throughout.

- The pair popup now opens full-screen so the Pairing Code QR has the whole
  terminal to render in. The QR itself is unchanged, so every released app
  version keeps scanning it.

- The pair popup's address checklist now pre-selects a single default address
  instead of every likely one: the address on the platform's primary interface
  (`en0` on macOS, `eth0` on Linux), falling back to the best-ranked private
  LAN, Tailscale, or ULA candidate when that interface is absent.

- The pair popup's QR screen now renders the code starting at the top row and
  trims trailing text to the pane height, so the QR can no longer be clipped
  into scrollback on short terminals.

- Starting a new Agent now opens its terminal as soon as the launch lands,
  instead of dropping back to the Agent list to hunt for the new row.
  Launches made from another Agent's screen switch straight over too.
  (refs #12)

- The Agent detail screen's More menu no longer duplicates Settings; that
  entry stays in the Console toolbar.

- Working agents in the Console list now show a live "solving" orb — a
  dotted sphere whose bands twist and click back into place (ported from
  Jakub Antalik's MIT-licensed thinking-orbs) — instead of the static blue
  Working capsule. Reduced-motion users get a still frame. (PR #106)

- The Agent list now sorts Done above Working and Working above Idle, in the
  Console and in the terminal's Agent row alike, so finished work surfaces
  next to the Blocked agents that still lead the list. Status colours moved
  onto herdr's own palette — green for Done, yellow for Working, red for
  Blocked, grey for Idle — so the phone and the TUI agree on what a colour
  means.

- The Agent Name field on the New Agent form is now optional: empty names the
  agent after its kind (`claude`, `claude-2`, …), matching how the herdr TUI
  labels unnamed agents, and the suggested name shows as the placeholder.
  Typed names are validated inline against herdr's naming rule instead of
  bouncing off the server.
- The theme pickers under Terminal Appearance now show a colour swatch for
  every theme (like the keyboard's Appearance pane) and a live preview of the
  current pick at the top of each page. The preview moved there from the
  Terminal Appearance root, and each picker renders its own appearance's half
  of paired themes regardless of the current system appearance.
- The Settings sheet is now a shallow menu with two pages, Notifications and
  Terminal Appearance, instead of one long mixed form. Per-Host notification
  rows no longer push the appearance controls out of reach, and the
  self-builder Custom Push Relay field moved to the bottom of the
  Notifications page.

### Fixed

- Opening an Agent no longer dies with `exec: herdr: not found` (exit 127) on a
  Host that installed herdr via Homebrew or linuxbrew. The API socket never
  needed `herdr` on `PATH`, so the Console could already list Agents; Attach
  and the other CLI execs now append the usual install prefixes after the
  session `PATH` (`~/.local/bin`, `/opt/homebrew/bin`,
  `/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin`). (#206)

- Malformed herdr API error responses that carry an empty id now fail the
  originating request immediately with the server's error instead of hanging
  until the request deadline. herdr answers unparseable requests with
  `id: ""`; because each API connection serves one request, that empty id is
  attributable to the sole in-flight request on the connection. (#177)

- On iPad, one window's keyboard no longer ends another window's keyboard
  handoff. Keyboard notifications are process-wide and each window can hold
  a live terminal, so a frame event from one window's keyboard transition
  could unfreeze the other terminal's grid before the keyboard had settled
  for it. A terminal now heeds a transition only for its own keyboard: it
  must be first responder, and a frame event must leave the keyboard
  covering its own window. Process-wide show/hide broadcasts no longer end a
  handoff. (#157; PR #175)

- Attach again withholds generic remote startup and SSH rc chatter until the
  attach command begins. The attach exec prints a short handshake marker
  immediately before `herdr agent attach`, and the client drops everything
  before it. A channel that dies before the handshake still emits the withheld
  text once as the diagnosis. (#166)

- An open Agent terminal no longer stays blank after the app may have suspended.
  Returning at or beyond the Background Grace Period, or after an observed
  suspension, now shows Connecting while the old PTY stops, then opens a new PTY
  Attach with a new terminal surface while preserving links, image actions, and
  pending Paste review. While the Host's replacement snapshot is still loading,
  the session screen also stays on Connecting instead of briefly claiming the
  Agent is gone. Brief trips out of the app keep the existing Attach and do not
  show Connecting. (#141)

- A Host that is reconnecting no longer tells you its Agent has gone. The
  session screen said "This Agent's pane is no longer reported" whenever the
  Agent list emptied, which a dropped connection does exactly as a closed
  pane does — so the app reported a permanent loss at the moment it was
  successfully recovering. It now says the connection dropped and is being
  re-established, and that there is nothing for you to do, which is the
  truth: nothing here needs you. A Host that failed for a reason only you
  can fix still shows what to do about it, and a pane that really did close
  still says so. (#154)

- The app no longer quits outright if two parts of the terminal screen read
  one Attach session at the same time — a stale view left behind by a screen
  transition was enough. The live terminal now keeps running untouched, and
  the duplicate reader is turned away with "Another terminal is already open
  on this Host." and a Reattach button, so the worst case is one surface that
  has to be reopened rather than the whole app disappearing. (#137)

- A turned-away duplicate terminal reader can no longer take the live
  terminal down with it. When the refused reader was a terminal screen, its
  cleanup ended the very session the refusal had just protected, so the
  working terminal went down anyway; and a duplicate reader whose task was
  already cancelled ended the working terminal's output silently, with no
  dialog at all. In both cases the live terminal now keeps running, and the
  refused surface alone shows "Another terminal is already open on this
  Host." with Reattach. (#151, #164; PR #174)

- A Host that fails while you have one of its Agents open now says why on the
  session screen. It used to read "This Agent's pane is no longer reported" —
  blaming the Agent for the Host's problem, and pointing you at the wrong
  thing to fix — because a failed Host empties the Agent list in exactly the
  way a closed pane does. The screen now carries the same connection guidance
  the Host list shows, so a stopped herdr reads as "herdr is not running on
  this Host…" where you are actually looking. A pane that really did close on
  a healthy Host still says so. (#146)

- Cancelling an image upload on a slow connection no longer kills the Host.
  The cleanup that follows a cancelled or failed upload ran on fixed
  two-second budgets, and running out of one was treated as evidence that the
  SSH connection was broken — so on a weak mobile link, cancelling an upload
  silently tore down Events, Attach, and everything else sharing that
  connection, and reported it as "The SSH connection is no longer reusable."
  on whatever you did next. Running out of time is no longer read as a broken
  connection, and the cleanup no longer opens a second connection it may not
  have time to finish. A connection that genuinely dies is still reported as
  dead. (#136)

- A Host that stopped with "herdr is not running on this Host" now recovers on
  its own once you fix it, however long you were away: restart herdr, come
  back to the app, and the Host reconnects without you doing anything else.
  Until now this depended on the length of the trip. Leaving the app for more
  than about twenty seconds tore the connection down, and coming back rebuilt
  it, so that route already worked; a quicker trip — or one where iOS froze
  the app before that teardown could run — did not, and the Host stayed failed
  with no way back but the Retry button. Every return now asks it once. A Host
  that is still broken simply says so again, with the same guidance and
  without flickering through a moment that looks like it reconnected. (#147)

- Coming back to a session after leaving the app no longer shows a connection
  that is already gone. Returning to the foreground now re-proves each Host,
  so one whose link died while you were away starts reconnecting — and says
  so — the moment you look at it, instead of appearing connected for up to
  another half a minute until the keepalive notices. (#142)

- A Host that drops off the network mid-request now reconnects on its own
  instead of stopping with the wrong advice. A severed link failed the same
  way a refused forward does, so Heeler blamed the Host's setup — "herdr is
  not running on this Host. If it is running, check SSH stream-local
  forwarding." — and treated it as something only the user could fix, which
  stops automatic reconnection. A dropped link now reports itself as an
  unavailable connection and retries, while a genuinely disabled forward or a
  stopped herdr still gets the setup advice. (#138)

- Hosts running herdr 0.8.0 connect again. The protocol check demanded the
  exact version this build was generated against, so herdr 0.8.0 (protocol
  19) failed preflight outright even though every method Heeler calls is
  unchanged. Heeler now requires a minimum protocol and accepts anything at
  or above it; a Host newer than this build still connects and simply notes,
  under the checklist, that features added after it may be unavailable. (#140)

- Host event updates now use herdr's socket directly over SSH, remain live
  while ordinary requests run, and recover cleanly when only the Events
  channel drops. Connection failures now lead with "herdr is not running"
  instead of exposing remote socket implementation language. (#117)

- Switching Agents — from the switcher strip, a notification, or right after
  starting a new one — no longer strands the terminal on "Connecting…"
  forever. The synchronous-departure fix let SwiftUI discard the departing
  screen's state before its teardown task ran, and the weakly-captured
  teardown then silently skipped itself: the old session was never closed,
  held the Host's single terminal channel, and every later attach queued
  behind it indefinitely. The teardown now keeps its store alive until the
  session is closed. Two hardenings ride along: a screen the Console no
  longer has on stage refuses to resurrect its terminal on a spurious
  reappearance, and teardown aborts a session still queued for the channel
  instead of waiting its turn.

- The Agent switcher strip and the keyboard toolbar no longer vanish when a
  raised keyboard comes back on its own — returning from the background or
  the lock screen with the keyboard up. Two causes, same round trip: the
  keyboard-height measure required a foreground-active scene while UIKit
  restores the keyboard just before activation, leaving the strip buried
  behind the keyboard; and the toolbar's hide animation was only ever undone
  on an explicit keyboard request, so a restored keyboard wore a transparent
  toolbar.

- The black-terminal-that-never-connects has lost its last hiding place. The
  earlier reattach fix assumed the spurious disappear/appear pair SwiftUI
  hands out arrives with a gap in between; when a notification deep link or
  the new-agent flow's push landed both in one transaction, the deferred
  teardown ran *after* the reattach had already decided there was nothing to
  undo, and the visible screen kept a permanently stopped terminal. The
  departure is now recorded synchronously in `onDisappear`, so the reattach
  on `onAppear` always sees it.

- Agent status colours are readable in light mode. The Working badge painted
  its text in Catppuccin Latte's yellow over a wash of the same yellow, which
  measured 2.3:1 — far under the 4.5:1 that small text needs — and Done's
  green fared little better; the keyboard switcher's status dot missed the
  3:1 an indicator needs on white. Badge text and the dot now use a darker
  ink of the same hue in light mode (dark mode already passed and keeps its
  pastels), so the phone still speaks herdr's colours, just legibly.

- A Host no longer gets stuck offline because one Agent's pane exited. The
  events subscription names each Agent's pane, and herdr rejects the whole
  subscription when a single one of those panes is gone, so a pane that ended
  while the Host was disconnected left every reconnect failing with
  "pane … not found" until the Host was edited or the app restarted. Pane
  subscriptions are now discarded on disconnect and reinstalled from the next
  sync, and a pane that exits mid-subscribe retries straight away instead of
  surfacing as a connection failure. Server rejections also read as herdr's
  own message now, not as a printed Swift value.

- Opening an Agent no longer flashes the Host's login shell across the screen
  first. The attach channel is a login shell, so its banner, its prompt, and
  its echo of the attach command all arrived before the Agent did, painted for
  as long as the attach took to come up, and were then wiped by the Agent's
  first frame. None of it reaches the terminal now, and "Connecting…" stays up
  until the Agent actually paints. If an attach dies before it starts, whatever
  the Host said is still shown — that message is the only diagnosis there is.

- Switching Agents with the keyboard up no longer starts the new terminal at
  full height and shrinks it a moment later, which also sent the "Connecting…"
  dialog jumping from the middle of the screen to the middle of the terminal.
  The keyboard's height now outlives the switch, like the raised keyboard
  itself already did.

- The terminal's status dialog wears the terminal theme instead of a system
  material card, so "Connecting…" and "Session Ended" stop looking like a
  piece of some other app over a Solarized or Nord grid.

- Opening an Agent from a notification no longer sometimes lands on a black
  terminal that never connects. The Attach screen tore its session down on
  every `onDisappear`, including the ones SwiftUI hands out for removals the
  user never made, and the screen that came back afterwards was the same,
  permanently stopped one: no output, no error, no way to reattach short of
  switching Agents. It now reattaches when it comes back, and a screen waiting
  for its terminal says so instead of showing nothing at all.

- The Agent list now removes rows from disconnected Hosts immediately, rejects
  stale snapshots that finish after a disconnect, and rechecks membership when
  an Agent process exits back to an ordinary shell.

- The terminal no longer arrives a beat late after the keyboard is dismissed.
  It now sizes itself to the keyboard directly instead of through SwiftUI's
  avoidance, which retracted in two stages and left the terminal resizing a
  second time — reflowing, resizing the remote PTY, and redrawing the whole
  TUI again — a third of a second after the keyboard had already gone. Raising
  the keyboard settles in one step too, and the app toolbar leaves in sync
  with the keyboard instead of lingering at the bottom of the screen.

- Attach no longer leaves a stale-width, non-interactive terminal on screen
  when an SSH input or resize write fails; the broken session now ends and
  preserves the underlying transport error.

- Terminal scrolling and typing stay responsive on lossy connections: touch
  momentum is coalesced and bounded, and fresh keyboard input no longer waits
  behind stale wheel events.

- Slow or stalled networks no longer leave SSH requests or Host lifecycle
  transitions stuck indefinitely. Request deadlines now return promptly,
  invalidate the unusable connection, and discard late connection attempts
  after the app suspends or reconnects.

- Holding the iOS keyboard's Backspace key now continues deleting instead of
  stopping after one character.

- Failed Host notices stay compact in the Agent list and open the affected
  Host directly, where an explicit reconnect action stays visible, animates
  while restarting, and leaves the latest connection error below it. (PR #107)

- Arguments typed on the New Agent form survive the iOS keyboard's smart
  punctuation: `--yolo` no longer reaches the Host as an em-dash garbage
  argument, and curly quotes normalize back to the straight quotes the
  argument parser understands.

- Taps forwarded to a mouse-tracking TUI now land on the cell Ghostty actually
  draws under the finger. The tap-to-cell mapper assumed a centred grid, but
  Ghostty anchors it at a fixed padding; the mismatch shifted reports by up to
  half a cell (worst on 3x screens) near cell boundaries.
- Tapping the terminal body no longer toggles the software keyboard. Ghostty's
  touch handling raised and dismissed the keyboard on any touch once it had
  been raised once, including after returning from a short backgrounding; both
  paths are now gated behind the input-row tap policy. (#95)
- The keyboard tap target in full-screen agent TUIs is now a wider caret band
  plus the bottom quarter of the screen, instead of the whole surface — output
  areas stay inert while every chat TUI's pinned input box remains hittable,
  whichever tool draws it. (#95, refs #90)
