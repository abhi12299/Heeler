/// Foreground recovery (#142): what the app does to its Host connections when
/// it returns from the background, driven through the same activity events
/// `HeelerAppModel` subscribes to.
///
/// A link that dies while the app is away produces no error at the moment it
/// dies, because nothing is attempting anything: the reconnect loop is parked
/// on an events stream that a frozen socket never ends. So the session comes
/// back reporting `.connected`, the Console keeps listing its Agents, and the
/// Attach terminal keeps rendering `.live` with no overlay.
///
/// What re-proving on return buys is **latency, not recovery that would
/// otherwise never happen**. The keepalive is still armed across the freeze —
/// this trip never suspends the session, so `stopKeepalive()` never runs — and
/// `ContinuousClock` advances while a process is frozen, so its expired sleep
/// returns promptly on thaw and the same `keepaliveDidFail` path notices the
/// dead link within its interval plus the request timeout. Foregrounding makes
/// that immediate, at the moment a user is looking at whatever the answer
/// means.
///
/// That mechanism rests on **code inspection, not measurement**. A simulator
/// never suspends the process, so nothing here — or anywhere in the suite —
/// demonstrates that the keepalive really survives a real iOS suspension and
/// fires on thaw. The "up to 45 s without this fix" figure is therefore read
/// off the tree (30 s interval plus the request timeout), not observed on a
/// device; anyone relying on the number should measure it before trusting it.
///
/// These tests therefore run in the **production keepalive shape**
/// (`.default`, 30 s), not with the keepalive disabled: every case here
/// settles in well under a second, so a 30 s timer provably cannot be what
/// recovered it, and removing `revalidate()` turns them red rather than
/// slower. That is what distinguishes the two mechanisms without putting a
/// test on the clock.
///
/// The trigger is a return *without an intervening suspension*: the grace
/// period absorbed the trip, or the process was frozen before its grace timer
/// could fire. Either way the app is back holding a connection nothing tore
/// down, and `resume()` alone has nothing to re-activate.
///
/// The adjacent state is a Host already stopped on a non-retryable failure
/// (#147). There `resume()` no-ops for the same reason — the reconnect loop
/// returned with the phase still `.active` — and the ping has nothing left to
/// ping, so on such a return nothing asks that Host again and the user's
/// natural recovery (restart herdr, come back) does nothing. The window is the
/// same one this whole file is about, and no wider: an absence past
/// `AppActivityCoordinator.defaultGracePeriod` suspends the session, and the
/// `resume()` that follows already restarted it. The return asks it once more.
/// That is a single attempt on an explicit user action, not a softening of the
/// classification: `herdrStoppedWhileAwayFailsTheHostWithItsSetupGuidance`
/// still pins that a stopped herdr fails rather than retries, and the cases
/// below pin that a still-broken Host lands straight back on `.failed` and
/// that a Host merely *reconnecting* is left alone entirely.
///
/// The remaining status a return can meet is `.suspended` — the ordinary case
/// once the grace period elapses, which the trips above deliberately stay
/// inside. There `resume()` is already dialling, and the re-prove must leave
/// that dial alone: widening the guard to `.failed, .suspended` restarts the
/// session over its own in-flight dial, and the return costs two dials
/// instead of one (#158). The statuses hide it — the Host still ends up
/// `.connected` — so the case below counts dials instead.
